## Overview:
This repository implements an innovative causal-aware spatiotemporal network designed for interpretable anomaly monitoring and root-cause analysis in complex industrial processes. By integrating a prediction-reconstruction framework, sequential causal graph inference, time-frequency feature fusion, and graph attention mechanisms, it effectively captures intricate spatiotemporal relationships among variables, enabling interpretable anomaly detection.
